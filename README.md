# Weather Forecasting using Time-Series Forecasting Project
## Introduction
Weather forecasting is a critical component of our daily lives as it helps us plan and prepare for various weather conditions. In this project, we will develop a time-series forecasting model to predict the weather for the next few days.

## Data Collection
We will collect weather data from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and radar systems. The data will include temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and other weather-related variables. We will also collect historical weather data to train and validate our model.

## Data Preparation
The collected data will be preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Missing values will be imputed, and outliers will be identified and removed or corrected. Feature engineering techniques will be used to extract relevant information and create new features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will perform exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables and identify patterns and trends in the data. This analysis will help us select the most relevant features for our model.

## Model Development
We will develop a time-series forecasting model using various algorithms, including Prophet. The model will be trained on the preprocessed data and validated using cross-validation techniques.

# Conclusion
The weather forecasting using time-series forecasting project will provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to weather patterns and develop a model that can accurately predict the weather for the next few days. This project can improve our ability to plan and prepare for various weather conditions and minimize the impact of adverse weather events.
